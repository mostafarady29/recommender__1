('Clinical Trials and Clinical Research: A Comprehensive Review', 'Clinical research is an alternative terminology used to describe medical research. Clinical research involves people, and it is generally carried out to evaluate the efficacy of a therapeutic drug, a medical/surgical procedure, or a device as a part of treatment and patient management. Moreover, any research that evaluates the aspects of a disease like the symptoms, risk factors, and pathophysiology, among others may be termed clinical research. However, clinical trials are those studies that assess the potential of a therapeutic drug/device in the management, control, and prevention of disease. In view of the increasing incidences of both communicable and non-communicable diseases, and especially after the effects that Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) had on public health worldwide, the emphasis on clinical research assumes extremely essential. The knowledge of clinical research will facilitate the discovery of drugs, devices, and vaccines, thereby improving preparedness during public health emergencies. Therefore, in this review, we comprehensively describe the critical elements of clinical research that include clinical trial phases, types, and designs of clinical trials, operations of trial, audit, and management, and ethical concerns.', '2023-02-16', 'https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10023071/pdf/main.pdf', 1, 8),
('Insights in public health education and promotion: 2022', 'The discipline of public health received much-needed attention with the pandemic of COVID-19 (1, 2). However, current public health education still needs to be expanded to traditional teaching models that balance theory and practice. With time, public health is also trying to integrate new technologies, especially in education and promotion (3). Primary care and public health comprise the backbone of health systems, but their divergence has produced two groups of practitioners, either focused on individual health or population/public health (4). Public health education is a precursor to public health practice and essential to one’s foundational knowledge and skillset. Thus, theoretical solid groundings are critical in public health education (5). The world is now in the third decade of the 21st Century. The achievements in public health made by scientists have been exceptional, especially in the last few years, leading to significant advancements in the fast-growing field of Public Health Education and Promotion (6). It is essential to highlight the latest advancements in public health science and to shed light on the progress made in the past decade. In addition, its future challenges needs to be identified to provide a thorough overview of the status of the art of the Public Health Education and Promotion field. For this Research Topic, we received all original research articles.', '2023-10-03', 'https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10579887/pdf/main.pdf', 1, 10),
('The impact of COVID-19 on palliative care social work', 'Background: The SARS-Cov-2 (COVID-19) pandemic affected the delivery of health and social care services globally. However, little is known about how palliative care social work services were impacted. Aim: The aim of this study was to capture and analyse data from palliative care social workers who provided professional support in a range of settings across 21 countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design: A cross-sectional survey-based design was used for this empirical study and this paper primarily focuses on the quantitative responses. Setting/participants: Participants, palliative care social workers, were drawn internationally via members of the EAPC Social Work Task Force and the World Hospice Palliative Care Social Work network. Results: We received 362 survey responses from 21 countries. Most (79%) respondents worked with adults in in-patient units or hospitals. The number of referrals during COVID-19 increased more in non-European countries, compared to European countries. The full range of social work services could no longer be delivered, existing services changed and 65.3% of participants reported higher levels of pressure during the pandemic, which was linked to higher levels of staff absence and additional duties. For many respondents (40.8%), this included facilitating online communication between patients and their families.', '2023-01-01', 'https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10186133/pdf/main.pdf', 1, 6),
('Nutrition in the Actual COVID-19 Pandemic: A Narrative Review', 'Abstract: The pandemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has shocked world health authorities generating a global health crisis. The present study discusses the main finding in nutrition sciences associated with COVID-19 in the literature. We conducted a consensus critical review using primary sources, scientific articles, and secondary bibliographic indexes, databases, and web pages. The method was a narrative literature review of the available literature regarding nutrition interventions and nutrition-related factors during the COVID-19 pandemic. The main search engines used in the present research were PubMed, SciELO, and Google Scholar. We found how the COVID-19 lockdown promoted unhealthy dietary changes and increases in body weight of the population, showing obesity and low physical activity levels as increased risk factors of COVID-19 affection and physiopathology. In addition, hospitalized COVID-19 patients presented malnutrition and deficiencies in vitamin C, D, B12 selenium, iron, omega-3, and medium and long-chain fatty acids highlighting the potential health effect of vitamin C and D interventions. Further investigations are needed to show the complete role and implications of nutrition both in the prevention and in the treatment of patients with COVID-19.', '2021-06-03', 'https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8228835/pdf/main.pdf', 1, 9),
('Systematic Review on CAR-T Cell Clinical Trials Up to 2022', 'Abstract: The development of Chimeric Antigen Receptor T cells therapy initiated by the United States and China is still currently led by these two countries with a high number of clinical trials, with Europe lagging in launching its first trials. In this systematic review, we wanted to establish an overview of the production of CAR-T cells in clinical trials around the world, and to understand the causes of this delay in Europe. We particularly focused on the academic centers that are at the heart of research and development of this therapy. We counted 1087 CAR-T cells clinical trials on ClinicalTrials.gov (Research registry ID: reviewregistry1542) on the date of 25 January 2023. We performed a global analysis, before analyzing the 58 European trials, 34 of which sponsored by academic centers. Collaboration between an academic and an industrial player seems to be necessary for the successful development and application for marketing authorization of a CAR-T cell, and this collaboration is still cruelly lacking in European trials, unlike in the leading countries.', '2023-02-04', 'https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9954171/pdf/main.pdf', 1, 7),
('A scoping review of continuous quality improvement in healthcare', 'Background The growing adoption of continuous quality improvement (CQI) initiatives in healthcare has generated a surge in research interest to gain a deeper understanding of CQI. However, comprehensive evidence regarding the diverse facets of CQI in healthcare has been limited. Our review sought to comprehensively grasp the conceptualization and principles of CQI, explore existing models and tools, analyze barriers and facilitators, and investigate its overall impacts. Methods This qualitative scoping review was conducted using Arksey and O’Malley’s methodological framework. We searched articles in PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and EMBASE databases. In addition, we accessed articles from Google Scholar. We used mixed-method analysis, including qualitative content analysis and quantitative descriptive for quantitative findings to summarize findings and PRISMA extension for scoping reviews (PRISMA-ScR) framework to report the overall works. Results A total of 87 articles, which covered 14 CQI models, were included in the review.
